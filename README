  Short term goals

  Long Term goals
  - Improve/speed up USER PROFILE creation for smoother transition between music apps
 
 
 Tools 
 Spotify for developer: Get_Playlist API
 Visual studio code: for code base
 Github: Git for version control 
 
Budget
Not required

I will be using my account and hence my OAuth token for the prototype of this project


STEPS
- Authenticate user
- Obtain playlists using GET method from Spotify API
- Parse each playlist using a webscrapper 
- 

Key Questions: 

- Can all playlist be access with or without an active spotify premium subscription: could affect API call if token cannot be assessed due to authentication 
- Is there a license required 
- Are there metrics to support this is a feasible solution to an existing problem.
